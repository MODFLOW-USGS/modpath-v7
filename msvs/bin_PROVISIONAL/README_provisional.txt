This software is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision.
It is being provided to meet the need for timely best science. The software
has not received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
No warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS or the U.S. Government
as to the functionality of the software and related material nor shall the
fact of release constitute any such warranty. The software is provided on

The provisional executable codes are provided temporarily for evaluation purposes
as a courtesy to users who are unable to compile the source code. An executable
compiled for a specific operating system might not be compatible with all
distributions of that operating system. In such cases, we ask that users please
work through any compatibility issues related to compilation. If there is evidence
of a problem with the source code, please report it as an issue on this repository.

The name of an executable file includes the operating system for which is compiled,
date it was generated, and the "develop" branch commit it is based on.  For example,
the name "mp7_win64_20230816_dbe916c" indicates that the executable is for 64-bit
Windows and was generated on 2023-08-16 using source code from commit dbe916c.
If there are multiple executables for a given operating system, the most recent
for that operating system is the one with the most recent date and commit number.
